# Conversational AI 

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent Conversational AI system tailored for customer service applications. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to handle customer queries efficiently and provide human-like responses. It also ensures seamless escalation to human agents for complex issues.

## Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user intents from natural language queries.
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracts relevant information like order IDs, dates, and product details.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Handles context-aware dialogues.
- **Human Escalation**: Transfers complex queries to human agents when necessary.
